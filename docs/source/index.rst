Introduction
============
Welcome to the documentation for the Phoenix (PHOX) Pipeline! The PHOX pipeline is a system that links a series of Python programs to convert files from a whitelist of RSS feeds into event data and uploads the data into a designated server. This reference provides a description of how the pipeline works and what it does. It is also written as a programming reference including necessary details on packages, modules, and classes needed to contribute to the codebase.
