TABARI.0.8.4b2
========================
TABARI (Text Analysis By Augmented Replacement Instructions) is an event coding program used to machine code even data from formatted source texts in the pipeline. It is dictionary-based and relies on sparse parsing and pattern recognition to identify 'who-did-what-to-whom' relations.
